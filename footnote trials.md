# footnote trials

Source for these trials: <https://medium.com/obsidian-observer/tufte-style-sidenotes-in-obsidian-89b0a785bc54>  

And this documentation: <https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Footnotes>  

Adding a footnote[^1] is not (or was not; see below) as easy as either Stowe Boyd or the Obsidian doc says. Where is the footnote? and how do I add it to this note? Why does it not look like the example?  

Footnote marks go at the end of sentences;-- really.[^2]  
So this is so odd. It wasn't working; and now it is.  

So let's add a ^[special note] in this line?  

[^1]: this is the footnote? is it?  
[^2]: ok, i added the note
[^special note]: why is this special?
