>[!cue] keep notes on the trials and errors

- install some of the Cornell-Notetaking-Learning-Vault (CNLV) elements  
	- CSS for cornell-notes
	- tufte-sidenotes require CSS and JS?

- with help from [[TfT Hacker]] i got some custom CSS for cues and
summaries  
- 2023-08-27: and with help from the `TfT Hacker` `Discord` I grokked that all the font attributes can be tinkered with[^1]

- i also learned from CNLV Discord that there are other call-outs in Obsidian (i really need to get out more)

>[!info] what on planet obsidian is this?



>[!summary] some initial notes on setting up and making adjustments

[^1]: it seems that i am settling on an add-the-date to the entry on note pages practice, but not sure, yet, what problem this solves (also why is this font smaller?)
