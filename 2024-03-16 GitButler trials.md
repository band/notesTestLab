# 2024-03-16 GitButler trials

- GitButler does not support `git` repos using submodules.
- This vault / repo will try to avoid the submodule install of `massivewikibuilder` and just manually (ouch!) keep re-installing the builder using a `.zip` file copy. (double ouch!!)

**2024-03-20**:
 - Dennis questioned avoidance of Github Desktop, so I have installed and set that up as well.
 - the main inquiry is about what can make using Github, branches, and pull-requests easy for Massive Wiki users.

 - one stumbling block for me is having a good visual model of the local repo, local branches, uncommitted updates (local), and then, what is actually on the repo, and also the whole pull-request thing
