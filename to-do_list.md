# to-do list  
>[!comment] (which shows that almost [every project needs a plan](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/ogm_stewardship/project_plans/template_for_project_(how_to_use)))

- this may turn out to be an ad-hoc list of imagined plans  

1. set this up as a Github repo (just to keep some history) 
	- 2023-08-21: kinda successful using `gh repo` commands, and then doing what `git` suggested when there were errors
2. list the primary experiments:  
	-  footnotes and sidenotes  
	- primary reference: <https://medium.com/workings/more-on-tufte-style-sidenotes-db61d3d8dce0>  
	- 2023-08-21: learned enough from the CNLV to make this vault/repo for my own learning (so: using a CNLV to learn, and reflect on that learning, about a CNLV). so, until another meta-thing shows up this activity has its own boundaries (do i have that right?).
